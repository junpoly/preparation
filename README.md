### Preface
I opened this repository for preparing coding interviews. I think analyzing any problem once you solve them is really
important. Now, I am not good at Data Structure and Algorithm so whenever I try to solve any Leet Code problem, I most
likely have to look up the solution. I feel bad the fact that I can't come up with any solution my own. This repository is going to come into play to supplement this weakness. This Easily obtained answers are usually easily forgotten.
I think I would just rather repeat the problems that were solved. What I should do is to make them completely mine by
regularly reviewing problem analysis that were done by me as well as source codes.
